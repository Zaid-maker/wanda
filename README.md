# Wanda Programming Language

Programming language for a tutorial series on building a compiler.

Yes, the language is named after Wanda Maximoff from Marvel comics and the MCU.

## The Language

Wanda is a simple language that compiles to JavaScript. It shares much with the semantics of JavaScript, including eager evaluation, first class functions that are closures, and prototypal objects with class syntax as a wrapper around the prototypal system.

It uses s-expressions for syntax like the Lisp family of languages, and some features are similar to Clojure. I've also borrowed some features from Racket.
